Echo State Network (ESN) implementation in numpy that calculates the Lyapunov exponents and 
the Covariant Lyapunov Vectors. Four prototypical chaotic systems are provided for 
testing. 

The ESN was implemented by Alberto Racca and the code can be found in https://github.com/alberacca/Echo-State-Networks based on the work: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2021.05.004

The implementation of CLVs follows https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.130601
